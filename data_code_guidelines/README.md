# Good practices in scientific programming - SILS/Plant Physiology
Welcome to this practical guide to data analysis and programming for the Green Life Scientist (but not only);

## Motivation
When you start working in one of the Green Life Sciences groups of Plant Physiology, it is very likely that you'll encounter issues and challenges related to data analysis and programming. Biology can now also be done with a :computer: nowadays.   

It is important then to embrace good practices from the start. Usually, one tends to think that a "magical" :crystal_ball: solution will happen by itself and that someone will sort everything out for you. Well, usually, that person is you because you know your experimental data better than anyone else!

This little guide will help you out in your journey by guiding you through a series of good practices. 

## Summary of what you need to do
1. Install a software called *Anaconda* that contains the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc..).
2. Familiarize yourself with Jupyter notebooks. Open it using the anaconda navigator. 
2. Create a Github account so that your code will be versioned controlled and hosted online. Create a repository (=folder) on Github that will host your next article or coding project.



# Jupyter notebooks

## Introduction
From the [official documentation](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html):
> Notebook documents (or “notebooks”, all lower case) are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc…). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.

But it is not only static! It also allows you to run code:
> The Jupyter Notebook App is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access (as described in this document) or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet.

# Getting started

## Installing the Anaconda distribution
Navigate to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and download the installer for Windows, Mac OS X or Linux.  
Then, follow the instructions for installation.

## Starting a Jupyter notebook
Start the Anaconda Navigator (these
