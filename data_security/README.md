:lock: :lock: :lock: :lock: :lock: :lock: :computer: :lock: :lock: :lock: :lock: :lock: :lock:

This little document is based on what I learnt when my laptop got stolen at the University. I hope it is useful for researchers to reckon why protecting your personal and research data is important. And help you to protect them with the maximum security.

This document will list: 
1. Why it is important to protect your research and personal data stored on your local machine (laptop or desk computer). 
2. What you can do to improve your data security.

# Why is it important to protect your data? 

Personal data: European GDPR. Can contain bank account 

# What can you do to protect your data? 

## Encrypt your hard drive

# What to do in case your computer gets stolen

## File a police complaint 
:police_car: :police_car: :police_car: :police_car: 
1. Go online to the [official police website](https://www.politie.nl/) 
2. Select ["aangifte-of-melding-doen"](https://www.politie.nl/aangifte-of-melding-doen).   
3. Go to "diefstal zakkenrollerij of inbraak" (theft, pickpocketting, burglary). 
4. Select "Er is iets anders gestolen".
5. You will then need to click on "Mijn Politie" and follow the procedure with your [DigiD](https://www.digid.nl/). 

You will be asked a few questions.

Your complaint will be processed (mine took a few hours). When you receive the police report ("aangifte"), please send it or bring it to:
1. [the ICTS service desk](#report-to-the-university-ict-helpdesk). 
2. The SP904 security desk. This will give you access to the :video_camera: video footage and perhaps help you to spot who did what.
