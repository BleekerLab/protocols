This document will list: 
1. Why it is important to protect your research and personal data stored on your local machine (laptop or desk computer).

1. Go online to the [official police website](https://www.politie.nl/) 
2. Select ["aangifte-of-melding-doen"](https://www.politie.nl/aangifte-of-melding-doen).   
3. Go to "diefstal zakkenrollerij of inbraak" (theft, pickpocketting, burglary). 
4. Select "Er is iets anders gestolen".
5. You will then need to click on "Mijn Politie" and follow the procedure with your [DigiD](https://www.digid.nl/). 

You will be asked a few questions.

Your complaint will be processed (mine took a few hours) and you will then receive the police report ("aangifte") that you have to send to the ICTS service desk and take to the SP904 security desk to get access to the :video_camera: video footage.
