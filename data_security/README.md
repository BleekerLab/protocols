# Research and personal data security

This little document is based on what I learnt when my laptop got stolen at the University. At the time I got: 
* :fearful: fearful "Oh, what did I exactly had on this laptop?".
* :angry: angry "What I'd like to do to the thief if I had him/her in front of me right now...". 
* :cry: sad "I am supposed to help others to take care of their data and I cannot take care of mine properly".
* :weary: weary "The only time that I don't lock up this laptop and it gets stolen". 

To get something positive out of this negative experience, I shaped this little tutorial on what can be done to improve data security and protection. I hope it is simple enough and useful for researchers to reckon why protecting your personal and research data is important. And help you to protect them with the maximum security.

This document will list: 
1. Why it is important to protect your research and personal data stored on your local machine (laptop or desk computer). 
2. What you can do to improve your data security.

# Why is it important to protect your data? 

## It protects you
You might have important information on your personal or work laptop / desk computer. Think whether you have passwords being stored in plain text files or saved in your web browser. Certainly, you have research data that you would like to preserve as well.  

## It protects others
You might also have contact information (phone, email, visiting address) of people you work with, family relatives or friends of yours. Ensuring the maximum level of protection will also protect them.

## It is legally required
As stated in the [Form for reporting a data breach (mobile devices)](UvA-AUAS_mandatory_data_breach_notification.pdf):  
> Since 25 May 2018, the (European) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is in effect. Included in the GDPR is an obligation to report data breaches. This obligation requires the UvA/AUAS to report data breaches to the Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) within 72 hours. 

## It protects your work
Although you might think that your research data are valuable to you and your group, some people might think the contrary...

# What can you do to protect your data? 

## Enable 2-factor authentification 
Whenever possible, make sure you activate __2-factor authentification (2FA)__.   

2-factor authentification (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to any account on top of your password. You will have to verify your identity through another measure:
* Copy-pasting a code that you have received through an email address or an SMS on your phone. 
* Saying "Yes, it is me" when prompted on your smartphone when you log in a website.
* On your smartphone, starting an app such as [Google Authentificator](https://google-authenticator.com/) that issues a code once you try to log in a website.  

A nice feature is that, if you connect from another location or machine, you will automatically be able to grant access or not.   

You can check [here](https://twofactorauth.org/) whether your cloud provider or other website provides 2FA.   
Here is a nice guide to understand and for this: https://www.fidelity.com/security/how-two-factor-authentication-works


## Encrypt your hard drive
Data encryption makes it hard or almost impossible for someone unauthorized to access your personal/research data. If you lose your laptop/external hard drive/desk machine or if it gets stolen, it will protect your files on this device. 

You could either encrypt each individual file or the whole disk. The latter is best since a _full disk encryption_ will protect all your files even when opened or being edited [see this document for Symantec for more info](./how_wholedisk_encryption_works.pdf).   

On Mac OS X, the __FileVault__ application takes care of the encryption.  
On Windows 7 and 10, the __BitLocker__ application is the one that does a similar thing.

# What to do in case your computer gets lost or stolen
:scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: :scream: 

## Use a "Find my device" tool
This will ensure that you can lock your device remotely and even erase important data from another machine.

### Apple Find My App tool
This app can be used to:
* find your device (smartphone or laptop)
* mark your device as lost
* send a custom message on the device ("this laptop has been lost/stolen, please call me at this number XXX").
* Remotely erase the data that are located on the laptop/computer. 

Complete information on Apple Support: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204756

### Windows Find my device
This device can be used to:
* locate your lost/stolen device.
* lock your device remotely.

## Report to the University ICT Helpdesk
<img scr="./keep-calm-and-call-the-servicedesk-ict.png" width="400px">  

Preferably phone them so they can guide you through the procedure.

- :email: Email: servicedesk-icts@uva.nl
- :phone: Phone: +31 (0)20 525 1402
- :clock8: - :clock6: They are opened from Monday to Friday from 8.00 to 18.00.


## File a police complaint 
:police_car: :police_car: :police_car: :police_car: 
1. Go online to the [official police website](https://www.politie.nl/) 
2. Select ["aangifte-of-melding-doen"](https://www.politie.nl/aangifte-of-melding-doen).   
3. Go to "diefstal zakkenrollerij of inbraak" (theft, pickpocketting, burglary). 
4. Select "Er is iets anders gestolen".
5. You will then need to click on "Mijn Politie" and follow the procedure with your [DigiD](https://www.digid.nl/). 

You will be asked a few questions.  

Your complaint will be processed (mine took a few hours). When you receive the police report ("aangifte"), please send it or bring it to:
1. [The ICTS Services helpdesk](#report-to-the-university-ict-helpdesk).
2. The SP904 security desk. This will give you access to the :video_camera: video footage and perhaps help you to spot who did what.
