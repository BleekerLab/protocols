# Recipe for degradome sequencing
Based on Zhai et al. 2014 Methods 84-90
__Important__: this protocol is for 10µg of total RNA. In the paper they recommend 75µg of total RNA but I downscaled it.
Total RNA has to be previously isolated and in stored in nuclease-free water. 

## mRNA isolation (Dynabeads) from isolated total RNA

### Ingredients
