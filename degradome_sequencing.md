# Recipe for degradome sequencing
__Important__: this protocol is for 10µg of total RNA.
Total RNA has to be previously isolated and in stored in nuclease-free water. 

## mRNA isolation (Dynabeads) from isolated total RNA

### Ingredients
*  Dynabeads oligodT (Ambion Dynabeads mRNA direct microkit catalog #61021: contains Lysis/Binding buffer, Washing buffer A & B)

6.  Pipet up and down 10 times.
7.  Place on magnetic stand. Remove and discard supernatant. Be sure to remove all that you can from buffer B.

### Final elution
1.  Remove from magnetic stand.
2.  Add 16µl nuclease-free water heated up at 80°C
3.  Pipette up and down 10 times.
4.  Place on magnetic stand. 
5.  Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.
6.  Store at -80°C for up to two weeks or keep on ice for immediate use. 

## RNA adapter ligation

### Ingredients
*  RNA adapter 5'-GUU CAG AGU UCU ACA GUC CGA C-3'
*  T4 RNA ligase and 10X buffer (Invitrogen, ref n°AM2141)
*  RNAse out (Thermofisher n°10777019)

### RNA adapter ligation
