## Blast server (Sequence Server) for tomato genomics

The following link redirects to a Sequence Server implementation that allows you to perform BLAST on custom resources.

Available resources:
- 19 Trinity-assembled de novo transcriptomes of wild tomato genotypes.  
- Two *S. habrochaites* genomes assembled through 10X Linked reads and Optical Mapping: LA1777 and PI127826.
