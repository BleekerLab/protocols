# Thrips survival assay
__Goal:__ assess the survival of western flower thrips on leaf discs of different tomato genotypes.

# Prepare an egg wave:
In a plastic box with a mesh filter (for aeration), place adult female thrips on green bean pods dusted with pollen.
The rule of thumb is to count 5 eggs/day/female thrips.
*  Day 1: place adult female thrips to lay eggs (1 female lays around 5 eggs per day)
*  Day 3: after 2 full days, eggs are layed.
*  Day 10: the first nymphs should be ready for experiments. Egg hatching depends on the environment conditions.

# Setup
1.  Fill each well of a 12-well plate with a 20mm Whatman filter paper with 500Âµl of tap water.
2.  Take a 1.5cm diameter leaf disc from the accession of interest
3.  Place the leaf disc in the well with the abaxial side ("down side of the leaf") upwards. 
4.  Seal with an adhesive transparent lid (adhesive seal for 96-well plate)

# recordings are done every day.
The analysis is a survival analysis also called "time to death". Thus, we only record:
*  __dead:__ dead thrips on day x: mark "1" in the corresponding the well coordinate and plate number
*  __alive:__ live thrips on day x: mark "0" in the well coordinate and plate number
*  __missing:__ if for some reasons you cannot find the thrips, mark "0" in the well coordinate and plate number
