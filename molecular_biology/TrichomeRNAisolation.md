# Total RNA isolation from tomato (stem) trichomes

## Reagents
Trizol (stored at -20°C)
Recipe for 500ml
*  190ml crystalline phenol (end concentration 38%, heat to 60°C to dissolve crystals)
*  59.08g guanidine thiocyanate (0.8M final)
*  39.56g ammonium thiocyanate  (0.4M final)
*  16.7ml 3M ph5 sodium acetate (0.1M final)
*  29ml 86% glycerol (5% final)
Fill to 500ml with water

Chloroform
Phenol:chloroform 1:1
Isopropanol
70% ethanol

## Protocol
1.  Place around 100mg of ground trichomes in a 2ml eppendorf tube
2.  Add 700µl of Trizol per 100mg of ground tissue
3.  Homogenize well
4.  Let the mixture become clear again. Leave 5' at room temperature or slightly warm up
5.  Add 200µl chloroform / ml of Trizol
6.  Vortex vigorously for 15sec
7.  Spin 5min at max speed (~14000xg)
8.  Transfer supernatant to a new tube
9.  Add 1/2 vol/vol of phenol:chloroform and vortex. 
10. Spin 5min at max speed (~14000g)
11. Transfer supernatant to a new tube
12. Add 1/2 vol/vol chloroform and vortex
13. Spin 5min at max speed (~14000g)
14. Transfer supernatant to a new tube. 
15. Add 1/2 vol/vol isopropanol (1 volume of isopropanol gives better yield but a more dirty pellet)
16. Precipitate 20min at room temperature (or 30min at -20°C, better yield but a more dirty pellet).
17. Spin 15min at max speed 
18. Discard supernatant. Add 500µl ethanol 70%
19. Spin 5min at max speed
20. Discard supernatant and add 500µl ethanol 70%
21. Spin 5min max speed
22. Discard supernatant. 
23. Resuspend the pellet in 30µl of nuclease-free water.
24. Store at -80°C
