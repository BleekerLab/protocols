# Total and small RNA isolation from plant tissues (Modified Qiagen Plant RNAeasy protocol) 

## Reagents
*  RNAeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Cat No./ID: 74904)
*  96% ethanol

## To do before starting
Buffer RPE is supplied as a concentrate. Before using for the first time, add 4 volumes of ethanol (96–100%) as indicated on the bottle to obtain a working
solution.
β-Mercaptoethanol (β-ME) must be added to Buffer RLT or Buffer RLC before use. Add 10 μl β-ME per 1 ml Buffer RLT or Buffer RLC. Dispense in a fume hood and
wear appropriate protective clothing. Buffer RLT or Buffer RLC containing β-ME can be stored at room temperature (15–25°C) for up to 1 month.

## Protocol (based on teh Qiagen Plant RNAeasy protocol)
1.  Add 450 μl Buffer RLT or Buffer RLC (see “Important points before starting”) to a maximum of 100 mg tissue powder. Vortex vigorously
2.  Transfer the lysate to a QIAshredder spin column (lilac) placed in a 2 ml collection tube, and centrifuge for 2 min at full speed. Carefully transfer the supernatant of
the flow-through to a new microcentrifuge tube (not supplied) without disturbing the cell-debris pellet in the collection tube. Use only this supernatant in subsequent
steps.
3.  Add 1.5 volume of ethanol (96%) to the cleared lysate, and mix immediately by pipetting. Do not centrifuge. 
4.  Transfer the sample (usually 650 μl), including any precipitate that may have formed, to an RNeasy spin column (pink) placed in a 2 ml collection tube (supplied).Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm). Discard
the flow-through.
5. On column DNAse digestion (see Qiagen protocol) 
6.  Add 500 μl Buffer RPE to the RNeasy spin column. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm) towash the spin columnmembrane. Discard the flow-through
7.  Add 500 μl Buffer RPE to the RNeasy spin column. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 2min at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm) towash the spin columnmembrane.
8.  Place the RNeasy spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube (supplied), and discard the old collection tube with the flow-through. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge at full speed for 1 min.
9.  Place the RNeasy spin column in a new 1.5 ml collection tube (supplied). Add 30–50 μl RNase-free water directly to the spin column membrane. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 1 min at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm) to elute the RNA.
